# Job Salary Prediction using NLP and Deep Learning

This project aims to predict the salary of a job posting based on its description, using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. Job postings are scraped from Polish job sites, and the model is trained on the collected data.

## Data Collection

Job postings are scraped from Polish job sites using web scraping techniques. The data includes the job title, description, and salary (if provided). 

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data is preprocessed to prepare it for training the model. This includes cleaning the text, removing stop words, and performing feature extraction.

## Model Training

The model is trained using a deep learning technique, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer network. The model is trained on the preprocessed data, using the job description as input and the salary as the output.

## Model Evaluation 

The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The model can also be tested on new job postings to predict their salaries.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of NLP and deep learning techniques to predict the salary of a job posting based on its description. The model trained on Polish job sites can be used to predict the salary of similar job postings in the future.
